<h2 align="left">What is Experience Unlimited?</h2>

<p>Many professional, managerial and technical workers who are out of work are helping each other find new employment opportunities through "job clubs" sponsored by the California
Employment Development Department (EDD).

<p>EDD&#039;s job club services are provided at <b>no fee</b> statewide through the Department&#039;s Experience Unlimited Program. A wide range of professional, technical and managerial job seekers participate in these job-hunting programs.</p>

<p>EDD offices provide space, equipment and a staff specialist for the club. This important service addresses the needs of job seekers who have lost their jobs as a result of corporate mergers, relocations, downsizing, and technological shifts.</p>

<p>Experience Unlimited members work together through the clubs to network and share job-seeking knowledge and experiences. Results have shown that these activities reduce the length of unemployment.</p>

<p>Experience Unlimited is <b>not</b> a recruiter or agency, or a resource for entry level talent.
