<p><strong>Converting a MS Word document to a text only document:</strong><br>

<p><strong>Where to Start?</strong><br>
Start with a MS Word resume to edit.  Open the resume word document using MS Word.</p>

<p><strong>Remove Readability Enhancements</strong><br>
Take out all tabs, columns, underlining, lines, bolding, centering, italicizing, indents, script, graphics, borders, and special formatting commands.  Highlight all text and select Arial or Courier 10 (a non-proportional font) and left align text.  Take off the bullets created with Word's bullet function.  Replace with asterisks (or dashes).  Check all lines carefully for words that have been dropped onto a line by itself.</p>

<p><strong>Tailor The Resume For Better e-mail Readability</strong><br>
Double check each line to make sure that it has no word wrapping and no extra spaces. Set the page margins at 6.5 inches.  For a section separator, use 65 dashes.</p>

<p><strong>Eliminate Non-Essential Information</strong><br>
Eliminate phrases that are not essential.  Minimize use of abbreviations.  Prepare keywords (nouns and phrases that highlight technical and professional skills) that reflect your expertise and experience.</p>

<p><strong>Remember They Need To Know Who You Are</strong><br>
Put name first and contact information on separate line.  Use white space.  Use common language.  Simplicity can be the most effective.  Omit personal pronouns and articles.</p>

<p><strong>Finishing Up</strong><br>
To save: use the “save as” function with a new file name.  Then select “text only” option in the “save as type” dialog box.  Email your resume to yourself to see how it looks.</p>
