<h2 align="left">Resume Tips</h2>

<p><strong>What Should My Resume Contain?</strong><br>
A resume should be filled with work and academic experiences that convey a strong sense of your skills and accomplishments.</p>

<p><strong>What Should My Resume Look Like?</strong><br>
Make sure your resume is pleasant to look at and a fast, easy read.  Bullet points about your life will tell the story of your career in a short amount of time.
</p>

<p><strong>What Should My Resume Say About Me?</strong><br>
In the “Highlights of Qualifications”, tell something about yourself, such as organized, experienced, multi-tasker, excellent personal skills, etc.
</p>

<p><strong>What Are Accomplishment Statements?</strong><br>
Although it is important to sum up your experiences, it is also important to show accomplishments such as how you consistently met deadlines, exceeded sales goals and cut expenses.
</p>

<p><strong>What Do Accomplishment Statements Look Like?</strong><br>
Quantify accomplishments.  Express them in dollars saved, percent of sales increased, percent of improvement, number of people supervised or a specific measurable.  Accomplishments should be in the format of Problem, Action, Results.
</p>

<p><strong>Focus the Resume on Success</strong><br>
Keep your resume focused on how you helped achieve your company’s goals.  Employers are less interested in the fact that you worked for a Fortune 500 company than they are in what you did to help make the company successful.
</p>

<p><strong>How Can I Help You?</strong><br>
Highlight what  a potential employer is looking for.  If you are applying for a CFO position, stress your skills in cash management, budgeting, cost savings, forecasting or raising capital.
</p>

<p><strong>Keep the Resume Short and To The Point</strong><br>
Lengthy career summaries and career objectives are not a good idea.  Your track record and accomplishments—not verbiage—will sell you.  Use active verbs, and avoid fancy ones.  Cut out meaningless phrases like results-oriented.
</p>

<p><strong>Getting the Edge</strong><br>
People who can help a company grow and make money have an employment edge.
</p>

<p><strong>Use Descriptive Job Titles</strong><br>
Make job titles brief and descriptive.  Example, “VP, Director" or "Manager of  Human  Resources.”
</p>

<p><strong>Tailor Your Resume</strong><br>
Don’t be afraid to change your resume for each job you are applying for.  If you have access to a computer and printer, this can be easily done.  State your experience and accomplishments that are relevant to each job.
