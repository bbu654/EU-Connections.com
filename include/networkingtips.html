<h2 align="left">Networking Tips</h2>

<p>Networking is the process of establishing and cultivating mutually beneficial relationships. 
Proficient networkers are the "go-to" people &mdash; not just because they can quickly 
identify who has what you need or who needs what you have, but also because they communicate quickly and effectively.</p>

<p><strong>Organize your personal and professional lives.</strong><br>
Keep records of who you meet and when you met them, plus such key information as their needs, desires and abilities -- and, most importantly, the best way to contact them.</p>

<p><strong>Get and use a Rolodex&reg; and personal organizer or an electronic equivalent.</strong><br>
Always record new acquaintances as soon as practical after meeting them.</p>

<p><strong>Be accessible.</strong><br>
Communication is the lifeblood of networking. Becoming incommunicado is good for hermits and celebrities, not professionals.</p>

<p><strong>Listen to people.</strong><br>
Networking requires communication, and you can't communicate if you don't hear what the other person is telling you.</p>
 
<p><strong>Keep communicating.</strong><br>
Regularly contact friends and acquaintances so that they remain an active part of your network.</p>
 
<p><strong>Work every gathering.</strong><br>
Introducing yourself allows others to stay in their comfort zones while you identify yourself as confidently assertive &mdash; i.e., a natural leader. Introducing other people not only helps you remember their names, it also reinforces your reputation as a mover and enabler.</p>
 
<p><strong>Shyness kills.</strong><br>
Be assertive about letting people know who you are, what you do, and what you are seeking without asking for a job. Do not bore people by detailing what you used to be or your transitional state of underemployment.</p>
 
<p><strong>Always ask for other people's business cards.</strong><br>
Not only does this get you an easily read copy of their particulars, it also prompts them to ask for one of your cards.</p>
 
<p><strong>Never give just a single business card.</strong><br>
You want the other person to always have one as a reference, even after giving several away.</p>
 
<p><strong>Never stop networking.</strong><br>
Contacts you make today can bring returns months and years from now.</p>
 
<p>A functioning network will open doors as the people who have seen your worth convince prospective employers that <strong>they need you</strong>.</p>
