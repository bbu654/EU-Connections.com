<h2 align="left">Networking Tips</h2>
<p>Networking is the process of establishing and cultivating mutually beneficial relationships.

identify who has what you need or who needs what you have, but also because they communicate
quickly and effectively.</p>

</dl><a name="access"><hr color="#333399"></a><dl>
<dt><strong>Be accessible.</strong></dt><dd>Communication is the lifeblood of networking. Becoming incommunicado is good for hermits and celebrities, not professionals.<br><br></dd> 
</dl><a name="listen"><hr color="#333399"></a><dl>
<dt><strong>Listen to people.</strong></dt><dd>Networking requires communication, and you can't communicate if you don't hear what the other person is telling you.<br><br></dd>

</dl><a name="gathering"><hr color="#333399"></a><dl>
<dt><strong>Work every gathering.</strong></dt><dd>Introducing youself allows others to stay in their comfort zones while you identify yourself as confidently assertive &mdash; i.e., a natural leader. Introducing other people not only helps you remember their names, it also reinforces your reputation as a mover and enabler.<br><br></dd> 
</dl><a name="shyness"><hr color="#333399"></a><dl>
<dt><strong>Shyness kills.</strong></dt><dd>Be assertive about letting people know who you are, what you do, and what you are seeking without asking for a job. Do not bore people by detailing what you used to be or your transitional state of underemployment.<br><br></dd> 
</dl><a name="buscard1"><hr color="#333399"></a><dl>
<dt><strong>Always ask for other people's business cards.</strong></dt><dd>Not only does this get you an easily read copy of their particulars, it also prompts them to ask for one of your cards.<br><br></dd> 
</dl><a name="buscard2"><hr color="#333399"></a><dl>
<dt><strong>Never give just a single business card.</strong></dt><dd>You want the other person to always have one as a reference, even after giving several away.<br><br></dd> 
</dl><a name="neverstop"><hr color="#333399"></a><dl>
<dt><strong>Never stop networking.</strong></dt><dd>Contacts you make today can bring returns months and years from now.<br><br></dd>
