         <li><b><i><a name="mem_hold">Can I put my EU membership "on hold"?</a></i></b>
            <br><br>
            "Active" members of EU who have completed all membership requirements may change their
            membership status to "inactive" by submitting a Change of Status Form.  Inactive members
            do not have access to chapter resources.  However, inactive members can reactivate
            membership within six months without going through the application process again.
            <br><br>

            Any member who fails to complete membership requirements for two consecutive months
            will also be declared "inactive".

            <br><br>
            No, but you can make this information public if you want to. While you are a member of EU, you may submit up to two "professional profiles" (abbreviated resumes) to the EU Marketing Department for distribution to local area employers and recruiters. Circulated profiles identify EU members by their EU identification number. You may elect to allow EU to release your name and contact information to interested employers, or you may elect to have EU contact you if an employer indicates an interest in your profile.
