<p><a name="eresumes"><b><u>Electronic Resumes</u></b></a><br>
Internet Recruiting has altered the fundamental nature of the job search. The widespread popularity of Internet Job Boards inundates Human Resource professionals with hundreds of relevant and irrelevant resumes for each job posting. This mismatched pool of resumes must be pared down to a manageable number of job candidates that closely matches the job requirements. 
The instructors will explain the concept of the online resume, the technology used by employers to receive, scan and read the resumes of job applicants, and offer other <a href="index.php?page=eresumetips">helpful tips</a>. Students will learn about the need for and use of keywords, how to convert and format a paper resume to one that can be sent electronically. When necessary, the instructors will help a student establish a Hotmail account with which to send and receive electronic resumes.

<p><a name="interview"><b><u>Interviewing Techniques</u></b></a><br>
This workshop is presented in two parts and covers the theory and practice of interviewing. It is designed to give students a better understanding of the significance of the interview in the overall process that employers use to determine the suitability of a candidate for employment.
Students participate in mock interviews with <a href="index.php?page=interviewing">questions posed</a> by the workshop instructors. This part of the workshop is videotaped. After the interview, the tape is played back as a tool for analyzing one's interviewing skills and techniques. The size of this workshop is limited.

Students are also required to submit a copy of their current resume and a sample job listing (ad) that describes the type of position they are seeking.

<p><a name="jumpstart"><b><u>Jumpstart Your Job Search</u></b></a><br>
Most professionals join Experience Unlimited with expectations of finding a comparable or better position in a short period of time. Sadly, this doesn’t happen in every case due to a variety of influences, some that the member can correct, and some that are beyond his or her control. 
 This Workshop is designed to help the member whose job search has become stagnant. The instruction is focused on helping members get their job search back on track by reviewing some of the basics that may have been overlooked or intentionally sidestepped. Individual job search activity and productivity will be evaluated.  Perceived barriers to finding another job will also be identified and discussed in a class setting. The instructors will offer corrective measures for students to make their job search efforts more productive.
<p>
<b><i>Prerequisites:</i></b> Membership in the Anaheim Chapter of Experience Unlimited for a minimum of 90 days and completion of all the required workshops. Members must complete and submit a Job Search Productivity Chart a full week prior to taking this workshop.
