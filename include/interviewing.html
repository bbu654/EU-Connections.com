<p><strong>PREPARING 
FOR THE 10 MOST COMMON INTERVIEW QUESTIONS</strong><br>
</p>
<p>Too 
many job seekers stumble through interviews as if the questions 
are coming out of left field. But 
many interview questions are to be expected. So study this list, 
plan your answers ahead of 
time and you'll be ready to deliver them with confidence. </p>
<p><strong>The 
Most-Dreaded Question: “Tell Me About Yourself”</strong><br>
This is also your greatest opportunity. You are likely to be asked this, 
so plan to use the open-ended nature of the question to your advantage. 
It is not necessary to answer autobiographically. You may wish to 
organize your thoughts around your interest in the job and why you 
are prepared to do it. </p>
<p><strong>What 
Are Your Weaknesses?</strong><br>
This question is best handled by emphasizing your strengths. Stay away 
from personal qualities and concentrate on professional traits: 
&quot;I am always working on improving my communication skills to 
be a more effective presenter. I recently joined Toastmasters, which 
I find very helpful.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>
Why Should We Hire You?</strong><br>
Summarize your experiences: &quot;With five years' experience 
working in the financial industry and my proven record of saving 
the company money, I could make a big difference in your company. 
I'm confident I would be a great addition to your team.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Why 
Do You Want to Work Here? </strong><br>
The interviewer is listening for an answer that indicates you've 
given this some thought and are not sending out resumes just because 
there is an opening. For example, &quot;I've selected key companies 
whose mission statements are in line with my values, where I know 
I could be excited about what the company does, and this company 
is very high on my list of desirable choices.&quot; </p>
<p>
<strong>What Are Your Goals?</strong><br> 
Sometimes it's best to talk about short-term and intermediate 
goals rather than locking yourself into the distant future. For 
example, &quot;My immediate goal is to get a job in a growth-oriented 
company. My long-term goal will depend on where the company goes. 
I hope to eventually grow into a position of responsibility.&quot; 
</p>
<p><strong>Why 
Did You Leave (Are You Leaving) Your Job?</strong><br>
If you're unemployed, state your reason for leaving in a positive context: 
&quot;I managed to survive two rounds of corporate downsizing, but 
the third round was a 20 percent reduction in the workforce, which 
included me.&quot; <br><br>
If you are employed, focus on what you want 
in your next job: &quot;After two years, I made the decision to 
look for a company that is team-focused, where I can add my experience.&quot; 
</p>
<p><strong>When 
Were You Most Satisfied in Your Job? </strong><br>
The interviewer wants to know what motivates you. If you can relate 
an example of a job or project when you were excited, the interviewer 
will get an idea of your preferences. &quot;I was very satisfied 
in my last job, because I worked directly with the customers and 
their problems; that is an important part of the job for me.&quot; 
</p>
<p><strong>What 
Can You Do for Us That Other Candidates Can't?</strong><br> 
What makes you unique? This will take an assessment of your experiences, 
skills and traits. Summarize concisely: &quot;I have a unique combination 
of strong technical skills, and the ability to build strong customer 
relationships. This allows me to use my knowledge and break down 
information to be more user-friendly.&quot;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What 
Are Three Positive Things Your Last Boss Would Say About You? </strong><br>
It's time to pull out your old performance appraisals and boss's 
quotes. This is a great way to brag about yourself through someone 
else's words: &quot;My boss has told me that I am the best designer 
he has ever had. He knows he can rely on me, and he likes my sense 
of humor.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>What 
Salary Are You Seeking? </strong><br>
It is to your advantage if the employer tells you the range first. 
Prepare by knowing the going rate in your area, and your bottom 
line or walk-away point. One possible answer would be: &quot;I am 
sure when the time comes, we can agree on a reasonable amount. In 
what range do you typically pay someone with my background?&quot;
